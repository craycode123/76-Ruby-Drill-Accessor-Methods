<div><p>Ruby provides a handy shortcut for creating <em>accessor methods</em>. Read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5046831/why-use-rubys-attr-accessor-attr-reader-and-attr-writer">this Stack Overflow answer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4370960/what-is-attr-accessor-in-ruby">the comments here</a>&nbsp;on how they work.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<h4>Replace with attr_helpers</h4>
<p>Read over the Ruby program provided until you understand the basic structure. Then load it into irb or <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">pry</a>&nbsp;and play around with it.</p>
<p>Next, identify which methods could be replaced with an <code class="inline">attr_reader</code>, <code class="inline">attr_writer</code>, or <code class="inline">attr_accessor</code> helper and do it.</p>
  <p>Write driver code to ensure your code still works in the same way. The purpose of this challenge is to refactor for clarity and concision, not alter the behavior of the program.</p>
